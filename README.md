KeyPair is a new intra-domain resilient source routing system. SDN controller pre-calculated PathID by using CRT (Chinese remainder theorem) property to encode shortest path route and backup links for each switch on the primary path. After calculation, edge-switch then append PathID on the packet header to safely forward packets to their destination. In our routing system, each switch contains two keys. Each route is defined as the remainder of the division between a PathID and switch key along the path. When the switches on the default path encounter a faulty link. Each switch uses a second key to reroute the packet to the destination without informing the controller failure. Results show that KeyPair efficiently deflects packets to their destination and maintaining high throughput and low packet loss rate.
